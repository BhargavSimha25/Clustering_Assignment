# Clustering Assignment
Welcome to the Clustering Assignment repository! This project focuses on the application of clustering techniques to explore and understand the structure of datasets by grouping similar data points into clusters.

### Introduction
Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique that organizes data into groups or clusters based on their inherent similarities. This assignment aims to apply various clustering algorithms to a dataset, analyze the results, and draw meaningful insights. The goal is to identify natural groupings within the data, maximizing similarity within clusters and minimizing similarity between clusters.

### Assignment Objectives
The key objectives of this clustering assignment are:

Data Preprocessing: Prepare and clean the dataset for analysis.
Algorithm Application: Apply clustering algorithms such as K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN.
Cluster Analysis: Evaluate the clusters using metrics like silhouette score and visualize the results.
Interpretation: Interpret the meaning and implications of the identified clusters.

### Examples
The repository includes examples and case studies demonstrating the use of different clustering techniques:

K-Means Clustering: Partitioning the dataset into a predefined number of clusters.
Hierarchical Clustering: Building a dendrogram to explore nested clusters.
DBSCAN: Identifying clusters of varying shapes and densities.
